          We will be providing a bus for certain schools that have over 40 registrations. If you would like a bus to be provided to your school you must make sure your school has a point person to coordinate the bus. Then, you should contact <a href="mailto:hackers@hackduke.org">hackers@hackduke.org</a> so that HackKitty or one of our organizers can help you get your school to HackDuke.

          <!-- Here are the universities that we are sending buses to and the times that they will be picking you up. You do not have a seat on the bus if you have not registered and confirmed your application for HackDuke. Speak with one of the student bus coordinators to double check on your status. And lastly, please be respectful of the bus, the driver and the student coordinator. The student bus coordinator reserves all rights to withhold your seat on the bus. -->
