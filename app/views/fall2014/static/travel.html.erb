        <h3 class="text-center">Saturday Parking Instructions & FAQ</h3>
        <p>
          Because there is a football game against Virginia Tech on Saturday, Duke will go into checkpoint mode at 9:00AM. Participants, mentors and sponsors will also not be allowed to park in PG4/Bryan Center, where guests usually park on non-football game days.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I get onto campus?</h3>
        <p>
          You must get onto campus via the intersection of Erwin Road and Research Drive.
          <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/36.0088817,-78.9426866/36.0029539,-78.9389637/@36.0058243,-78.9427818,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!4m1!3e0">Here are directions</a> to where you need to go in order to get as close to CIEMAS as possible.
        </p>
        <h3>Where do I park?</h3>
        <p>
          All vehicles must park in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/2298+Hillsborough+Rd,+Durham,+NC+27705/@36.0104431,-78.9248098,3a,75y,20.12h,82.28t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sVu8n9QgNP1bBoDrBLsQ6mQ!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x89ace3ff6ae53ea9:0x498c73ab1db10303!6m1!1e1">R1 Lot</a>, on the intersection of Hillsbourough Road and Carolina Avenue. This lot is behind the Harris Teeter.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I get to the venue from the lot?</h3>
        <p>
          Since this location is quite a distance from FCIEMAS, we will be providing a shuttle from the parking lot to FCIEMAS in the morning, that will follow <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/36.002954,-78.9389569/36.0104875,-78.9257604/@36.0093662,-78.9434335,15z/data=!3m1!4b1">these directions</a> to get to FCIEMAS.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I get back to the lot from the venue?</h3>
        <p>
          For anyone who needs to get back to the lot during the event, they can order an Uber. We will only be providing shuttles in the morning.
          <br>
          <br>
          You may head out at 9 p.m. or stay hacking until the wee hours of the morning, but whenever you need to head home from HackDuke, Uber's got you covered. With fares 38% lower than a taxi on average, there's no cheaper way to get around the Triangle - <a href="https://get.uber.com/go/HackDuke">and if you sign up now using code HackDuke, your first ride will be FREE (up to $20)</a>!
        </p>
        <h3>What do I do if I have passengers and/or swag to drop off?</h3>
        <p>
          If you are bus driver and have any items or people to drop off for the event, you must enter Duke via <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir///@36.0088242,-78.9425266,3a,75y,185.68h,90.1t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s6PX5TudhJzTp2PfUQrg1UQ!2e0">Erwin Road & Research Drive</a>.
